1. My project is a personality quiz. It is called "Chiikawa Personality Quiz." It gives you a set of questions that you have to answer by clicking on the options. Based on your answers, you'll get a character from Chiikawa that will best represent you.
2. I made my project mainly because of Girls Who Code, but it's also a really fun game to share with friends. I shared this test to some of my friends and I learned a little more about who they are.
3. I made my project using CSS, HTML and JavaScript. I followed the videos that GWC gave us. I first designed the background of the website and the buttons in CSS and by adding images to the asset folder. I also added my headers for the questions and the title and changed the design for them to. I kept the website a lavender theme. I then linked the buttons so when you clicked on the answer buttons, it'll give you a resulting character by creating var for each charater and then adding event listeners, elementIDs, and a function where you disable the other buttons when you click on one of the options. I also added a youtube link where it shows you insight to the chracter that you get. I also added a nav bar in CSS and the index.html so I could explain to the user more about the character's personality.
4. I struggled most with the JavaScript. It was most difficult as I kept on missing various bugs and I was confused on how to link the 5th and 6th questions. I learned how to link videos to Youtube, how each button is connected to the questionButton, how to create custom cursors, how disabling buttons worked, and how to get an output in the console.
